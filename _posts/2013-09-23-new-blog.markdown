Hello everyone, this is *yet* another attempt of mine to keep an updated blog.

I still have an account on wordpress, but this time, I wanted to have something with less overhead.

I noticed a colleague of mine using [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/), liked the idea and just went ahead with trying it.

The installation was pretty straightforward and it was easy to understand the workflow to manage the content.

I've currently set it up to detect changes in the content folder so that it automatically regenerates the html of the blog.

With the regeneration in place upon change, I created a repo out of the content folder. So if you're reading this, it means
I was able to git push this article from my laptop to my Pelican blog.

Next on my list: import (what I deem are) the most popular articles from my old blog.
